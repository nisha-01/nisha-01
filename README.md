-Achieved 95% accuracy in face matching.
-Automated KYC verification, reducing manual processing time.

**Project-AI Tool For Therapy Session**
Description:
This project automates the analysis of therapy sessions by transcribing recordings using Google‚Äôs API, summarizing key points with a Crew AI agent and OpenAI's GPT-4 model, and extracting future plans. It also uses BERT for sentiment analysis to assess the patient‚Äôs emotional state.

Key Contributions:
-Developed transcription and summarization pipelines using GPT-4.
-Implemented sentiment analysis with BERT.
-Extracted key insights and future plans for therapists.

Technologies Used: Google API, Crew AI, OpenAI GPT-4, BERT, Python

Results/Impact:
-Streamlined therapy session analysis, improving workflow efficiency and insights.

**Document Extraction**
Description:
This project focused on automating the extraction and categorization of legal documents, including PDFs, images, and DOC files. The process involved OCR using Google Document AI, followed by categorization and information extraction using Crew AI and an LLM. The goal was to streamline the handling of legal documents for faster processing and better organization.

Key Contributions:
-Developed the LangFlow, enabling seamless integration of the project‚Äôs various components.
-Collaborated closely with the team to implement OCR, categorization, and extraction processes.
-Contributed to optimizing workflows and ensuring smooth communication across different project stages.

Technologies Used:- Langflow,Langchain Google Document AI, Crew AI, LLM, Python

Results/Impact:
-Enhanced team collaboration and reduced the time spent on manual document processing by automating categorization and extraction.
