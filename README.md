### **EGlobal Doctor**, Pune, Maharashtra  
**Data Scientist**  
*Aug 2023 â€“ Jun 2024*

**Project: Seizure Prediction from EEG Data**  
**Description**:  
The project aimed to automate seizure prediction from **EEG data** using a **spectral feature-based two-layer LSTM network**. The primary goal was to build an effective machine learning model capable of predicting seizures in advance, using time-series data from EEG recordings. This would help in timely interventions for patients suffering from epilepsy.

**Key Contributions**:  
- Implemented the **spectral feature extraction** process from EEG data.  
- Developed and trained a **two-layer LSTM network** for seizure prediction.  
- Preprocessed EEG data to ensure high-quality input features for training.  
- Evaluated the model performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

**Technologies Used**: Python, **TensorFlow/Keras**, NumPy, Pandas, **Scikit-learn**, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks.  
**Results/Impact**:  
- Improved seizure prediction accuracy by **20%**.  
- Reduced the time required for seizure detection, enabling earlier interventions.  
- Enhanced the overall reliability of seizure predictions, contributing to better management of epilepsy.
